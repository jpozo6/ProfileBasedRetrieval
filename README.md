# ProfileBasedRetrieval
The student is required to implement an information retrieval engine targeted at delivering small text snippets to different users depending on their profile.

3 different files of code are available:
- Profile-based_IRS: it contains the actual system that, given a text snippet, automatically sends it to the users that might be interested in it using the most accurate classifier.
-  Models: it contains different trained machine learning models for text classification that were used as attempts to find the best one.
-  EDA: an auxiliary notebook employed to develop some figures that might be useful to understand the properties of the dataset.

As they are all contained in Python notebooks, the only requirement is to install all dependencies runing the cell where the "pip install -r requirements.txt" is included (the "requirements.txt" file is also available here).

In addition, an Apache open license is included in this repository to ensure that all code contained in it is open source code.
